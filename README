This repository holds example code that can be used to
develop projects using DOSLIB as a submodule (much like
Project 16 does already).

All samples here require Open Watcom 2.0.

Prior to running make, you will need to use your Linux
shell to source the Open Watcom environment variables
for compile to work.

If you use setenv.sh from Open Watcom, then locate your
Open Watcom binary build directory.

If Open Watcom is in /opt/rel/watcom, then:

. /opt/rel/watcom

You may also consider using the owenv.sh script in DOSLIB:

. doslib/extprac/owenv.sh

This will set the environment variables in your current shell
to use Open Watcom tools.

They will remain until you exit your shell. They are not
permanent.

This example only supports dev on Linux, sorry.
