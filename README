This repository holds example code that can be used to
develop projects using DOSLIB as a submodule (much like
Project 16 does already).

All samples here require Open Watcom 2.0.

Prior to running make, you will need to use your Linux
shell to source the Open Watcom environment variables
for compile to work.
